# Maid

You start talking to the bulter and ask her side of the story.

Maid:

"I got off shift at 9:15pm and started preparing to head out. While I was getting my stuff on the 1st floor, I heard many thuds coming from the bedroom. It sounded like people fighting and screaming so I went running up to check what was happening, when I entered I saw the bulter in the room looking panicked."

Meanwhile you're here you deicde to talk to the bulter as well.

Bulter:

"I was just on the 4th floor cleaning the house and I heard a loud scream and thuds! I panicked and and hurried down stairs. When I entered I saw the dead body on the floor, no one else was in the room yet."
