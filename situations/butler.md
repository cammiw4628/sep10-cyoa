# Butler

You start talking to the butler and ask his side of the story.

Butler:

"I was just on the 4th floor cleaning the house, and I heard a loud scream! I panicked and hurried downstairs. When I entered, I saw the dead body on the floor; no one else was in the room yet."

Meanwhile, you're here; you decide to talk to the maid as well.
