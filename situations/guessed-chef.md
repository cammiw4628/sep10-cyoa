# You lock up the chef

You have decided the chef was responsible for the killing and arrested him. After some time, it's proven that the chef wasn't the killer! The killer remained on the loose.

Due to your failed attempt at figuring out who it was, your boss fires you because the chef sued for wrongful imprisonment!
