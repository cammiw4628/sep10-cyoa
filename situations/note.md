# Note

The note is from the victim that died!!!!

The victim wrote "I don't know why but I have a feeling I am in danger. I feel like someone has been watching me and knows my every move. I do not feel safe at all. My chef is still preparing my meal, he said it will take around an hour, since he wants to cook something new for me. My butler was doing paper work for my next meeting right now. My maid got off shift at 9:15 p.m, her usual time. I am writing this at 9:23 p.m."

You need more information, so you check the bedroom.
